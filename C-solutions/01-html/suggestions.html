    <!-- In this section, create a form that allows people to send questions to the customer service department of your online business. Your form should have text inputs for a person's name and email address as well as a dropdown list (select tag) for the type of question [Bug Report, Feature Request, Sales, Other] and a text area for the question itself.

    Each element of the form should be on it's own line, and each element should have a label identifying what it is, e.g. Name, Email, Query, and Question. Add an action to the form that points to this page, and add a Submit button that triggers the action. Naturally, the form won't do anything except  reload the page, but it's a start! -->

    <!-- SOLUTION: You have used the <br> tag to separate lines. Generally we try to avoid the br tag because it is a stylistic tag only and does not add information about the structure of the page. Use divs to section off material. Our form ends up pretty ugly. In a future lesson we're learn how to use css to add styling -->
