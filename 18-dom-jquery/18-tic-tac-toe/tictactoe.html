      // place all of your code inside the jQuery ready function

      $(function() {
        
        // Most applications are composed of data models and views. Data models record the internal
        // state of the application while views reveal that state to the user and provide a way for
        // the user to change it. The primary responsibility of application code is then often to keep 
        // the application state and the views in sync. When the state changes, so too must the view, 
        // and vice versa.

        // Our application is a game, so we need to maintain a game state for the model, for example,
        // an internal representation of the game board (does a cell have an X, an O, or is empty), 
        // and which player's turn it is. We must explicitly keep track of any information needed to 
        // play the game.
        
        // Our application's view is just the html we already have above. We'll need to write code that 
        // modifies the game state as the user interacts with the view, namely, when a player clicks
        // on one of the table cells, and then updates the view accordingly, e.g. adds an X or an O. 
        // We can use jQuery for this.


        // Step 1: Set up the application game variables
        
        // Our first step is to define the variables we need to manage game state. We will use three.
        // The matrix is the internal representation of the tic-tac-toe board. Just as the table is a
        // two dimensional picture of a game board with rows and columns, so too is our matrix. We'll
        // use what's called a two dimensional array, or an array of arrays, to represent it.

        // Our two dimensional array will use string values to track whether there is an X or O in a spot.
        // It will use the empty string to indicate that no player has selected that position yet.
        // For example, the "matrix" board will initially look like this:

        //  [ 
        //    ["","",""], 
        //    ["","",""], 
        //    ["","",""] 
        //  ];

        // Notice how we have an outer array with the first pair of brackets [], and then inside it three
        // other arrays that each contain three empty strings. This way we can represent the three rows and
        // three columns of the board. After the first player places an X in the middle spot, the game state
        // will look like this:

        //  [ 
        //    ["","",""], 
        //    ["","X",""], 
        //    ["","",""] 
        //  ];

        // A winning game state for player 1 (X) after a number of moves may look like the following,
        // with player 1 (X) winning across a diagonal:

        //  [ 
        //    ["X","","X"], 
        //    ["O","X",""], 
        //    ["X","O","O"] 
        //  ];

        // We can access the value at a particular location in our two dimensional array using brackets.
        // Recall that we access an item in an array using a bracket with the index we want, for example:
        // array[0] returns the zeroeth item (the first one because array indices start at 0).
        // Well we have an array of arrays, so when we access a location in the outermost array, we get
        // back one of the inner arrays, namely, one of the rows:

        // var row = matrix[0];

        // Row is itself an array with three columns that we'll access with brackets again:

        // var row0column0 = row[0];

        // But we can combine all of this on one line to immediately access a position in the two dimensional
        // array:

        // var row0column0 = matrix[0][0];

        // Given our winning game state above, what is the value at matrix[0][0]? It is the string "X",
        // which corresponds to the top left position in the matrix. What is the value at matrix[0][1]? 
        // It is the empty string "", at the zeroeth row and the one-eth column. And what is the value at 
        // matrix[1][0] is an "O". Make sure you understand why. 

        // We also need a variable that tracks whose turn it is (player 1 or 2) and another to determine 
        // whether we're currently playing a game or if the game is over. We'll use the numbers 1 and 2
        // to tell which player's turn it is, and we'll set gameon to true when we're in the middle of 
        // playing a game and false when the game is over.

        // Here we're just defining the variables. You don't actually need to set any values. We'll use
        // functions to manage the values, so keep reading!

        var matrix;
        var player;
        var gameon;

        // Step 2: Create a function that resets the game state

        // We're going to break our game into a number of well defined functions that we'll call
        // as the players plays the game. Our first function resets the game state. That is, it removes
        // all X's and O's from the game matrix, sets the player to player 1, and sets gameon to true.
        // Update the matrix, player, and gameon variables accordingly, replacing "undefined" in each
        // case with the correct value. Refer to the Step 1 instructions for hints on what these values
        // should look like.

        function resetGameState() {
          matrix = undefined; // [your code here]
          player = undefined;
          gameon = undefined;
        }

        // Step 3: Create a function that resets the game interface

        // We'll reset the game interface in a separate function. This function should remove all the X's
        // and O's from the visible game board and set the info text to "Turn: Player 1". Use jQuery to do this.
        // You only need to make two function calls with jQuery to do both of these things.

        function resetGameInterface() {
          // [your code here]
        }

        // Step 4: Create a function that resets the game

        // This function should just call the two functions above.

        function resetGame() {
          // [your code here]
        }

        // Step 5: Create a function that sets the player variable to the next player

        // This function updates the current player. If the player is player 1, set the player to player 2,
        // and if the player is player 2, set it to player 1. Try using the ternary operator to do this. It's
        // a compact form of an if-else statement. Look it up on google if you're not familiar with it.

        function nextPlayer() {
          // [your code here]
        }

        // Step 6: Create a function that checks to see if the game has a winner
        // Return an "X" or an "O" if that player has won, otherwise return the empty string ""

        // This function determines whether a player has won the game by inspecting the game state for
        // all possible winning combinations. Recall how a player wins tic-tac-toe: either by placing their
        // mark across any row or any column, or by placing their mark across one of the two diagonals.
        // Our code should check the matrix variable to see if any row, column or diagonal contains the
        // same mark, and if it does, return that mark. Otherwise, it returns the empty string.

        // I've written a check for the rows to help you get started. Make sure you understand what the 
        // row check is doing and why it's written this way before writing the other checks.

        function gameWinner() {
          
          // Check across all rows
          
          for ( var r = 0; r <= 2; r++) {
            if ( matrix[r][0] != "" && matrix[r][0] == matrix[r][1] && matrix[r][0] == matrix[r][2] ) {
              return matrix[r][0];
            }
          }

          // Check across all columns

          // [your code here]

          // Check diagonals

          // [your code here]

          // If we got this far, there is no winner

          // [your code here]
        }

        // Step 7: Create a function that checks to see if the board is full

        // This function look at the board and determines if all the locations have been used.
        // If so it returns true, otherwise it returns false. The function ignores whether there 
        // is a winner. It only cares if all the spots have been taken.

        // We'll use this function along with the gameWinner function to determine if there is a tie.

        function boardFull() {
          return undefined; // [your code here]
        }

        // Step 8: Create a function that checks the game state for a winner or a tie
        // Update the interface to show the winner. If there is no winner and the game isn't over advance to the next player.

        // This function is responsible for determining the state of the game after a player has moved.
        // It performs all the work of checking if a player has won or if the game has tied. It informs the players
        // if one of them has won. If a player has not won but the board isn't full, it makes sure the game is ready
        // for the next player's move. Refer to the function itself for additional instructions

        function checkGameState() {
          
          // First find out if there is a winner or the board is full. You've already written functions
          // to do this, so you just need to call them here.

          var winner = undefined; // [your code here]
          var full = undefined;
          
          // If there is a winner, update the info paragraph to let the players know who won
          // But if the board is full, update the info paragraph to let them know the game is tied

          // [your code here]

          // If there is a winner or the board is full, set the gameon variable to false. This will
          // prevent players from making additional moves below.
          // Otherwise, update the player variable so that it's the next player turn and update the 
          // info paragraph to let the player's know whose turn it is.

          // [your code here]
        }

        // Step 9: Create and bind an event handler for a mouseclick in a table cell
        // This event handler does two things: 
        // 1. updates the game matrix and the interface to reflect it
        // 2. Calls a function to see if there's a winner

        // This is the core event handler for a game. It is the function that will be called when a user clicks
        // in a table cell.

        // Our application is effectively an "event driven application". We don't really do anything until the user 
        // interacts with it. Many modern applications based on graphical user interfaces (GUIs, like a web page) 
        // are event driven, waiting for user input before taking action.

        // This function does quite a bit. It's reponsible for updating the internal game state and the game interface,
        // e.g. placing an "X" or an "O" in the correct spot while ensuring that a player doesn't overwrite a spot
        // that's already taken, and then checking the game state to see if there's a winner.
      
        // I've completed this function for you. You don't need to write any additional code. 
        // See the comments in the function for details on how it works.

        $('td').click(function() {
          
          // First check to see if we're actually in the middle of playing a game, and if we aren't, "bail".
          // This is why we track the gameon variable. Our click handler is always active, ready to handle a
          // mouse click on the game board. So we need a way to ignore mouse clicks if we aren't actually
          // playing the game. What's another way we could have set this behavior up?

          if ( !gameon ) {
            return;
          }

          // Get the element we just clicked and log the data-position attribute

          var $el = $(this);
          console.log( 'table cell clicked:', $el.attr('data-position') );

          // Extract the row and column from the data-position attribute.

          // Often we'll need to include custom data in the interface that relates it to the model. 
          // When the user clicks on a cell in the table, that doesn't actually tell me anything about which
          // position in the game matrix I need to update. So I effectively embed an index hint into the table
          // cell using the custom data-position attribution.

          var row = +($el.attr('data-position').charAt(0));
          var col = +($el.attr('data-position').charAt(1));

          // Make sure a player hasn't already clicked here, and bail if they have, flashing a game error

          if ( matrix[row][col] != "" ) {
            $el.addClass('flash');
            setTimeout(function() { $el.removeClass('flash') }, 600)
            return;
          }

          // Set the new character: update the game state and the interface

          // This is where I update the matrix using the row and col values I extracted from the table click,
          // and then immediately update the visible game board to keep it in sync with the game matrix.
          // Basically we need to set an "X" or an "O" in two places: the internal game state and the visible interface.

          matrix[row][col] = player == 1 ? "X" : "O";
          $el.text( matrix[row][col] );

          // Check the game state

          // Now that we've updated the board, we should check to see if there's a winner or if the game has tied
          // We could have placed all that code directly in this function, but because it constitutes a functional whole,
          // I went ahead and placed it in its own function. This keeps our code organized and readable.

          checkGameState();
        });

        // Step 10: Bind a click on the restart button to the resetGame function
        // You don't need to do anything else here.

        $('#restart').click(resetGame);

        // Final step: Start up a new game
        // We can actually start a game by calling the resetGame function, which prepares the game state
        // and the game interface for a new game. You don't need to do anything else here.

        resetGame();
