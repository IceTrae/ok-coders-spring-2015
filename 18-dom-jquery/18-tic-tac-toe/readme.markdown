## Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an additional exercise that implements a fully functional game of tic-tac-toe in a web page using the technologies we have learned so far. It uses HTML and CSS with Twitter Bootstrap to build the game board and other interface components, and it uses JavaScript and jQuery for the actual game engine.

You have two options for this exercise. You may build a tic-tac-toe game from scratch or you may work through the included *tictactoe.html* exercise. The included file is a template for the game with the html and css already set up and some of the more difficult jQuery. It then contains a number of functions that you need to complete in order to get the game working.

If you decide to work through the included exercise, make sure you look over the entire file first and read all the instructions before writing any code. You want to have a solid understanding of how the game keeps track of information and when changes happen in response to user actions. Having this high level overview of how the game works and how the code is organized will help you to fill out the specific functions.

Feel free to start by working on your own version of tic-tac-toe first and then referring to the included exercise for hints and strategies on how you might implement the game yourself.
